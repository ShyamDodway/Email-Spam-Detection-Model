# **Email Spam Detection Model** ðŸ“©  

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as **spam or not spam** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  

---

## **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset used is a **combined email dataset from Kaggle**, consisting of both spam and non-spam (ham) emails.  

- **Feature:** Email text  
- **Labels:**  
  - `0` â†’ Not Spam (Ham)  
  - `1` â†’ Spam  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised classification model  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Preprocessing email text  
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorization  
- **Libraries Used**: Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Pandas  

---

## **Model Training Process**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Removal of stop words, punctuation, and special characters  
   - Converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF  
2. **Splitting Data**:  
   - Train-test split to evaluate model performance  
3. **Model Selection**:  
   - Experimented with Logistic Regression and NaÃ¯ve Bayes  
4. **Evaluation**:  
   - Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## **How to Use the Model**  
- The trained model is used to predict whether an email is spam or not.  
- Users can input any email text, and the model will classify it accordingly.  

---

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Implement **deep learning** techniques for improved accuracy.  
- Add **real-time spam detection** via a web application.  
- Train on **larger, more diverse datasets** to enhance performance.
